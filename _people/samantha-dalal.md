Samantha Dalal is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Information Science. Her research analyses the role of data in the relationship between workers and their work environment in the platform economy. She focuses on how unprecedented quantification has fundamentally re-organized workplaces and how workers react to and cope with these new environments. In particular, she explores the real-world implications of platform labor on workers' information seeking and generation behaviors. She received her bachelors degree at UCSB where she double majored in Statistics and Economics.
