Hello! I'm Jack, a graduate student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I recently graduated with a BS in Information Science, coupled with a Business Real Estate minor, and I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree, in the graduating class of 2025. 

While interning at DISH Network over the summer of 2024, I leveraged data science techniques through Python, SQL, and machine learning to develop actionable insights and recommendations. I presented these findings to business leaders seeking data-driven solutions, further developing my leadership and communication skills. 

I have always had a love for technology and all things computing which shaped my academic journey. I am grateful for the opportunity to continue my education in Boulder, where I look forward to learning even more and expanding my capabilities. 

Outside the classroom, I enjoy being outdoors, skiing, and traveling, and I place great value on family. Meeting new people might be my biggest passion of all, so feel free to send a message. Let's connect and chat!
