## Background
Wikimedia Foundation Projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikidata, compose massive, collaborative online knowledge repositories. Naturally, these databases encode critical information about queer individuals, identities, and communities. As such, understanding how queerness is treated on these platforms is important for understanding how queerness becomes data.

## Interventions
In addition to systems research and theoretical contributions, research funded by The Gill Foundation will be used to inform interventions that identify issues, enable remedies, and streamline Wikipedia edit-a-thons for the improvement of queer individuals' article content and connections.
