## Overview

**Data sonification** is the practice of communicating data through sounds --- graphs for your ears. But unlike visualizations, which many of us have been looking at since we were young, most of us have to learn how to interpret sonifications by developing analytic listening skills. But what if a voice assistant could help you craft personalized sounds that meaningfully represent data, help you train your ear to listen to them, and respond as you ask questions about the data you are hearing? These kinds of interactions could support people as they develop new capacities to learn and think using technology, as well as encourage general audiences to engage more deeply with data and sound.


## Key Research Questions

* What interaction and narrative patterns can support people in learning how to listen closely to music, sonifications, and other sounds?
* How might we design interactive, conversational voice recipes that scaffold people as they learn how to listen to data narratives?
* How do peopleâ€™s relationships with interactive, voice-based data narratives support sensemaking over time?

## Examples of conversational sonification

In this project, the goal is to develop new interaction technologies for people to engage with sonifications in a conversational setting. Ultimately, we will use voice assistants as a platform for exploration, but we are building from how people might explain sonifications in a conversation way on the radio. Here are some examples sonifications embedded in an interview narative for the radio show *Marketplace*:
