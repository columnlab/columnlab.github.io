Are you interested in developing new methods for data scientists and social scientists to understand online communities on Reddit?

A common way that researchers have defined online communities is to measure user’s activity in a given online space (for example, which users have joined or posted on a particular subreddit). But does this definition really capture what users care about? We are seeking talented undergraduate students to help us study this question and design new metrics for predicting users’ “sense of community” on Reddit. 

Two types of analytical paradigms will be used. When you apply, please specify which of the following two you are interested in and how your background experiences will support you to succeed: 

(1) Applicants with a background in quantitative social science methods as well as computational methods are encouraged to apply. You will complete tasks such as retrieving and analyzing public log data from the Reddit API. Preferred qualifications: Jr./Sr. level student in Information or Computer Science; Coding experience (e.g., python, API usage, statistical analysis in Jupyter notebooks or R); Self-motivated and independent learner of new data science techniques; Exceptional critical thinking and collaboration skills; Excellent attention to detail.

(2) Applicants with a background or strong interest in learning qualitative methods are encouraged to apply. You will have opportunities to develop skills like conducting interviews and surveys, as well as thematic analysis of transcripts and survey responses. Preferred qualifications: Jr./Sr. level student in Communications, Media Studies, Psychology, or related Social Sciences; Familiarity with Reddit as a user or moderator; Exceptional communication and interpersonal skills; Willing to form and express opinions openly and respectfully in a group setting.

We value your personal experiences and identity as they relate to your own use of these online spaces and communities. You will work with mentors who are dedicated to your success on this project and to your career as a junior researcher. Expect to learn how to develop new methods and conduct large-scale empirical studies in online contexts that often have crucial implications for the offline world.
