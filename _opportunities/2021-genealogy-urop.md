**NOTE: THIS POSITION IS FILLED AND NO LONGER ACCEPTING NEW APPLICATIONS. Check back in the future for new opportunities.**

Are you interested in developing new methods for data scientists and social scientists to understand online communities on Reddit?

A common way that researchers have defined online communities is to measure user’s activity in a given online space (for example, which users have joined or posted on a particular subreddit). But does this definition really capture what users care about? We are seeking talented undergraduate students to help us study this question and design new metrics for predicting users’ “sense of community” on Reddit. 

Applicants with a background in quantitative social science methods as well as computational methods are encouraged to apply. You will complete tasks such as retrieving and analyzing public log data from the Reddit API. Preferred qualifications: Jr./Sr. level student in Information or Computer Science; Coding experience (e.g., python, API usage, statistical analysis in Jupyter notebooks or R); Self-motivated and independent learner of new data science techniques; Exceptional critical thinking and collaboration skills; Excellent attention to detail.

We value your personal experiences and identity as they relate to your own use of these online spaces and communities. You will work with mentors who are dedicated to your success on this project and to your career as a junior researcher. Expect to learn how to develop new methods and conduct large-scale empirical studies in online contexts that often have crucial implications for the offline world.

**Positions FILLED for Fall 2021**: Check back for new opportunities in the future!

**Pay Rate**: $15/hour, 10-20 hrs/week

**Project Mentor**: Dr. [Estelle Smith](https://columnlab.github.io/people/estelle-smith) ([c.estelle.smith@colorado.edu](mailto:c.estelle.smith@colorado.edu))

Interested applicants should send an email to Dr. Estelle Smith. Please include your resume or CV, transcript of coursework completed, and a brief description of: (1) why you are interested in the position and (2) how your background prepares you for success in this role.
