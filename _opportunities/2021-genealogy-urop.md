# Advancing Data Science of Communities on Reddit and Wikipedia
## Project Mentor: Estelle Smith (c.estelle.smith@colorado.edu)
## Description
Are you interested in developing new methods for data scientists to understand online communities?

A common way that researchers have defined online communities is to measure user’s activity in a given online space. For example, which users have joined a particular subreddit? Or which users have contributed to a particular Wikipedia article? But does this definition really capture what users care about?

We are looking for talented undergraduates who want to help us design new metrics for predicting users’ “sense of community” in online spaces like Reddit and Wikipedia. You will have opportunities to develop skills like survey analysis and retrieving public log data from Reddit or Wikipedia APIs. 

We value your personal experiences and identity as they relate to your own use of these online spaces and communities. Applicants who have a background in quantitative social science methods as well as computational methods are encouraged to apply. You will work with mentors who are dedicated to your success on this project and to your career as a junior researcher. 

Expect to learn how to develop new methods and conduct large-scale empirical studies in online contexts that often have crucial implications for the offline world.
